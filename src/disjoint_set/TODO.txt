Internal Mutability:
Implement union()

TODO

Order of working on this:
     Make a working single-threaded version of the program.
     Make it multi-threaded.
     Add tests to check the multi-threaded capabilities.
         (hopefully try and manually specify the order that hypothetical threads would run
         different functions, probably just throw a load of threads at the problem and see if
         anything breaks).
      Implement Kruskal's algorithm (as a test)
